In the quiet depths where shadows creep,
A soul wanders, but cannot sleep.
The world spins on, yet still I stand,
A lonely figure in a barren land.

Whispers echo in the hollow night,
Lost voices, fading out of sight.
The weight of silence, heavy, true,
A heart adrift, with no one to pursue.

The stars above, so cold, so far,
A fleeting dream, a distant star.
No hand to hold, no voice to hear,
Just endless sorrow, sharp and clear.

A tear that falls, a whispered sigh,
Beneath the dark and endless sky.
Loneliness, a wound so deep,
A secret that I’ve learned to keep.

Yet still I walk, though all is grey,
In search of light, in disarray.
For even in the darkest night,
A spark may rise, to chase the fight.

But until then, I’ll bear the pain,
As sadness pours like endless rain.
For in this world, where all is lost,
Loneliness remains the highest cost.
